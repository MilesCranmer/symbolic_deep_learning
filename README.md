## Requirements

For model:

- pytorch
- [pytorch-geometric](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric)
- numpy
- [Eureqa](https://www.nutonian.com/download/eureqa-desktop-download/) (symbolic regression)

For simulations:

- [jax](https://github.com/google/jax) (simple N-body simulations)
- [quijote](https://github.com/franciscovillaescusa/Quijote-simulations) (Dark matter data)
- tqdm
- matplotlib

## Training

To train an example model from the paper, try out the [demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mWK5LiSPYXG1qQBxvhwdLgvfhTrFBbsr/view?usp=sharing): 

> TODO ðŸ“‹Describe how to train the models, with example commands on how to train the models in your paper, including the full training procedure and appropriate hyperparameters.


## Pre-trained Models

You can download pretrained models here:

- [My awesome model](https://drive.google.com/mymodel.pth) trained on ImageNet using parameters x,y,z. 

> TODO ðŸ“‹Give a link to where/how the pretrained models can be downloaded and how they were trained (if applicable).  Alternatively you can have an additional column in your results table with a link to the models.

## Results

On the Newtonian simulations, each of these models achieve the following performance:

### [Image Classification on ImageNet](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-imagenet)

| Model name         | Top 1 Accuracy  | Top 5 Accuracy |
| ------------------ |---------------- | -------------- |
| My awesome model   |     85%         |      95%       |

> ðŸ“‹Include a table of results from your paper, and link back to the leaderboard for clarity and context. If your main result is a figure, include that figure and link to the command or notebook to reproduce it. 


## Contributing

> ðŸ“‹Pick a licence and describe how to contribute to your code repository.
